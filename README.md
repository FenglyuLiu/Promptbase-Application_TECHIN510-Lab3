## Introduction

Promptbase is a simple web application built with Streamlit that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage writing prompts. This application is designed for writers looking for a structured way to capture and revisit their ideas.

- **Favorite Prompts:** Users can mark prompts as favorites.
- **Edit Prompts:** Existing prompts can be edited.
- **Delete Prompts:** Prompts can be removed from the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The main programming language used.
- **Streamlit:** An open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
- **PostgreSQL:** Used for the database to store prompts.
- **psycopg2:** A PostgreSQL database adapter for Python.

## How to Run This Code
Open the terminal and run the following commands:

    python -m venv venv
    
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt




## What's included
- **app.py**: The main Python script with Streamlit code.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing the project's dependencies.
- **.env**: A file for environment variables (not tracked in version control for security reasons).

## What I Learned
- **Streamlit Framework**: Gained hands-on experience in building and deploying web applications with Streamlit.
- **Database Management**: Learned how to integrate a PostgreSQL database with a Python application using psycopg2.
- **Frontend Customization**: Explored how to customize the frontend using Streamlit widgets and CSS for better user interaction.
